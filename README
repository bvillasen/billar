Chaotic Billards

This is a CUDA enhanced simulation for a peridic grid of disks (2D) or spheres (3D).

How to run:
  The simplest way to run the simulation is:
    python billar.py
  this will run the dynamics for 2M particles and 10000 collitions per particle
  
  To set the number of particles use: part="number of particles", for example:
    python billar.py part=10000000 
  will run the dynamics for 10M particles and 10000 collitions per particle
  
  To see a real-time animation of the particles positions over time use the key-word "anim":
    python billar.py anim
  This will run the animation for 2M particles.
  You can also change the number of particles for the animation:
    python billar.py anim part=40000 
    
  To see an interactive plot of the average squared radius the particle occupancy over time and  use "plot":
    python billar anim plot
    

For 3D:
  Everything is the same as for 2D just use the file billar3D.py instead. For example
  pytthon billar3D.py anim plot
